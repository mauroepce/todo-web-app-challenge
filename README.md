# React TODO app with Redux


## Instructions

The purpose of this application is to register your pending (TODO's from now on) being able to add them to the list, delete them and/or mark them as finished (edit them). This app connects with a REST API (read-only json server) to keep saved data outside of the app, which API also allows you to perform the same actions mentioned above.
This is the API: `https://my-json-server.typicode.com/AlvaroArratia/static-todos-api`.
I am also using this library for toast notifications:  https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction/
